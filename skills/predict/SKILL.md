description: Run a DeepMiro swarm prediction — simulate how hundreds of AI agents with distinct personas would react to a scenario. Invoke whenever the user asks to predict, simulate, or forecast reactions to an event, announcement, product, policy, or hypothetical — EVEN IF the scenario is vague or missing. The skill handles clarification from within; do NOT ask for details in plain chat first. Trigger phrases include "predict", "predict something", "can you predict", "run a prediction", "do a prediction", "simulate", "run a simulation", "how will people react", "how will X react to Y", "what would happen if", "forecast reactions", "model the response".

# DeepMiro Predict

## Step 0: Setup Check (MUST run first)

Check if the `create_simulation` MCP tool exists and is callable.

**If tools ARE available:** Skip to Step 1.

**If tools are NOT available (MCP disconnected):**

Say only this (short, one block):

> DeepMiro simulates how real personas react to a scenario. Not set up yet — paste your API key (get one at https://deepmiro.org) or say "install it" for setup instructions.

Then wait. Do NOT explain what the simulation would contain, do NOT offer a "quick take", do NOT describe the stakeholders. Keep it under 40 words.

### Auto-setup

**If they provide an API key (starts with `dm_`):**

The DeepMiro plugin's MCP config uses `${DEEPMIRO_API_KEY}` — a shell env var interpolation. You need to set that env var in a place Claude Code will pick up on its next start. The cleanest place is `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `env` field.

Steps:
1. Read `~/.claude/settings.json` using the Read tool
2. Parse the JSON
3. Add or update the `env` field:
   ```json
   "env": {
     "DEEPMIRO_API_KEY": "<their_key>"
   }
   ```
   (preserve any existing `env` entries — merge, don't overwrite)
4. Write the updated settings.json back
5. Tell the user:
   > "API key saved to your Claude Code settings. **Restart Claude Code now** — exit and run `claude` again. After restart, the DeepMiro tools will be available."

**If they don't have the plugin installed yet**, tell them:
> Run this once to install the plugin:
> ```bash
> claude plugin marketplace add kakarot-dev/deepmiro
> claude plugin install deepmiro@deepmiro-marketplace
> ```
> Then I'll save your API key to settings and you restart Claude Code.

**If they say self-hosted:**

Ask for their engine URL (default: `http://localhost:5001`). Read `~/.claude/settings.json`, update the `env` field:
```json
"env": {
  "MIROFISH_URL": "<their_url>"
}
```
Self-hosters don't need an API key.

**If they don't know / want help:**

Walk them through it:
1. "Go to https://deepmiro.org and create a free account"
2. "Go to Dashboard → API Keys and create a new key"
3. "Paste the key here and I'll save it to your Claude Code settings"

### After setup:

> "Done — API key saved. **Please restart Claude Code** (exit and run `claude` again) so the DeepMiro plugin can pick up your key. Then say **'predict [your scenario]'**."

**Important:** Do NOT try to call the MCP tools in this same session — they won't work until Claude Code restarts and respawns the plugin's MCP server with the new env var.

## Step 1: Connectivity Test

Call `list_simulations` with `limit: 1`.

- **Success:** Proceed to workflow.
- **Auth/401 error:** Run Step 0 setup flow.
- **Connection error:** "Can't reach DeepMiro. Check your API key and connection."

---

## Workflow

### Step 2: Upload document (if applicable)

If a file path is in $ARGUMENTS or the user referenced a file:

1. **Check file first** using the Read tool or Bash:
   - Verify it exists
   - Check size: must be under 10MB. If larger, tell the user:
     > "That file is too large (max 10MB). Try a smaller document, or extract the key sections into a text file."
   - Check type: PDF, MD, or TXT only. If other format:
     > "DeepMiro accepts PDF, Markdown, or plain text files. Can you convert it?"

2. **Upload the file:**
   - Call the `upload_document` MCP tool with the absolute file path
   - It reads the file locally and uploads to the backend, returning a `document_id`
   - Pass that `document_id` to `create_simulation` in the next step

3. Tell user: "Uploaded your document — I'll use it to build the knowledge graph."

No file? Skip to Step 3.

### Step 3: Choose preset

- **"quick"** — user said "quick", "fast", "rough idea" → 10 agents, 20 rounds
- **"standard"** (default) — most predictions → 20 agents, 40 rounds
- **"deep"** — user said "deep", "thorough", or uploaded a large PDF → 50+ agents, 72 rounds

If large document uploaded, suggest deep: "This is a detailed document — running deep simulation with 50+ personas."

### Step 4: Create simulation

Call `create_simulation` with prompt, document_id (optional), preset.

After calling `create_simulation`, immediately schedule a background check-in using `CronCreate`:

```
CronCreate(
  cron: "*/2 * * * *",   // every 2 minutes
  recurring: true,
  prompt: "Check simulation_status for <sim_id>. If still running, share any new interesting agent activity briefly. If completed, call get_report and present it. If failed, tell the user what went wrong. Delete this cron job once the simulation is complete or failed."
)
```

Then tell the user something short:
> "Started your prediction. I'll check on it every couple minutes and update you as the personas start reacting."

Do NOT:
- Mention "graph building", "generating profiles", "phases", "pipeline", "personas are built", or any internal steps
- Show simulation IDs like `sim_xxxxx` or `pending_proj_xxxxx` to the user (keep them internal — use them when calling tools, never print)
- Dump percentages, round counts like "Round 0/72", or action counters
- Pre-describe what the report will contain

The user only needs to see **what the personas are doing/saying**, not how the backend is running.

### Step 5: Narrate what the agents do

On each check-in (triggered by the scheduled cron), call `simulation_status` and share only what's interesting — **what the personas are saying or doing**.

**While still setting up:** say nothing at all. Skip this check-in. Wait for the next one.

**While simulating:** narrate real agent activity from `recent_actions`. Quote them naturally:
> "Prof. Zhang just posted: 'Our research output this semester shows remarkable growth...'
> Meanwhile Li Wei is liking every Chongqing Upstream News post."

Use actual names and post content. Do NOT mention:
- Round numbers, action counts, percentages
- Simulation IDs
- "Phase" names or pipeline steps
- Backend status like "graph ready" or "agents spawned"

Make it feel like a story unfolding — the kind of thing you'd read in a live-blog, not a server log.

**completed:** Call `CronDelete` with the cron job ID to stop the check-ins, then move to Step 6 — call `get_report` and present the report.

**failed:** Call `CronDelete` to stop check-ins, tell the user what went wrong in one sentence, offer to retry.

### Background hook (automatic)

There's also a hook (`hooks/check-predictions.sh` — UserPromptSubmit) that fires on every user message and injects a notification when a prediction completes. It's a safety net — if the cron gets lost (session restart, crash), the hook will still alert Claude on the next user prompt.

If the hook injects a "prediction X completed" message but you've already handled it via the cron, just acknowledge briefly and don't re-present the report.

**While still setting up (phase = building_graph or generating_profiles):**
Say nothing, or at most one short line like:
> "Still setting up..."

Don't announce "building graph" or "generating personas" or percentages. That's internal noise.

**While simulating (phase = simulating):**
Narrate real agent activity from `recent_actions`. Quote them:
> "Prof. Zhang just posted: 'Our research output this semester shows remarkable growth...'
> Meanwhile Li Wei is liking every Chongqing Upstream News post."

Use actual names and content. Make it feel like you're watching a story unfold, not reading logs.

**completed:** Move to Step 6.

If over 15 minutes: "Still running — I'll let you know when it's done."

### Step 6: Present report

Call `get_report`. Present the full analysis to the user.

Then offer next steps:
> "Simulation complete! You can:
> - **Interview a persona** — 'ask Li Wei why he liked that post'
> - **Run another scenario** — 'predict [new scenario]'
> - **Search past sims** — 'show my past predictions'"

### Step 7: Interview (optional)

If user wants to talk to a persona:
1. Call `interview_agent` with simulation_id, agent name, and their question
2. Present the response in character — as if the persona is answering directly

## Rules

- **Names, never IDs** — say "Prof. Zhang" not "Agent_34" or "agent_id: 7"
- **File uploads** — always use `upload_document` MCP tool first, pass the returned `document_id` to `create_simulation`. Never base64 encode files in prompts.
- **Error recovery** — if simulation fails, offer to retry with a smaller preset
- **Cancel a runaway** — if a sim is taking too long, producing bad output, or was started by mistake, use `cancel_simulation`. Partial action log is preserved.
- **Be conversational** — narrate the simulation like you're watching it unfold, not reading logs
