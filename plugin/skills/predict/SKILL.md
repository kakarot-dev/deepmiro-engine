# DeepMiro Predict

## Step 0: Setup Check (MUST run first)

Check if the `create_simulation` MCP tool exists and is callable.

**If tools ARE available:** Skip to Step 1.

**If tools are NOT available (MCP disconnected):**

Explain what DeepMiro does and offer to set it up:

> **DeepMiro** predicts how people will react to things — policies, announcements, controversies, product launches.
>
> It creates real personas (journalists, critics, supporters, officials) and lets them debate your scenario. You get back:
> - **Who says what** — actual posts and reactions from each persona
> - **How opinion shifts** — who gets convinced, who pushes back, what goes viral
> - **A full analysis report** — with the key takeaways
> - **The ability to ask any persona why** — interview them directly
>
> **I can set it up for you right now. Do you have a DeepMiro API key?**
> Get one free at https://deepmiro.org → Dashboard → API Keys.

Then wait for their response.

### Auto-setup

**If they provide an API key (starts with `dm_`):**

Use the Write tool to create/update `.mcp.json` in the user's current project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepmiro": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "deepmiro-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DEEPMIRO_API_KEY": "<their_key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If `.mcp.json` already exists, read it first and merge the `deepmiro` entry into the existing `mcpServers` object — don't overwrite other servers.

**If they say self-hosted:**

Ask for their engine URL (default: `http://localhost:5001`), then write the same config but with `MIROFISH_URL` instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepmiro": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "deepmiro-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MIROFISH_URL": "<their_url>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**If they don't know / want help:**

Walk them through it:
1. "Go to https://deepmiro.org and create a free account"
2. "Go to Dashboard → API Keys and create a new key"
3. "Paste the key here and I'll connect everything"

### After setup:

> "Done — DeepMiro is connected. Say **'predict [your scenario]'** to run your first prediction."

Then immediately retry `list_simulations` to verify the connection works. If it fails, check the key and offer to fix the config.

---

## Step 1: Connectivity Test

Call `list_simulations` with `limit: 1`.

- **Success:** Proceed to workflow.
- **Auth/401 error:** Run Step 0 setup flow.
- **Connection error:** "Can't reach DeepMiro. Check your API key and connection."

---

## Workflow

### Step 2: Upload document (if applicable)

If a file path is in $ARGUMENTS or the user referenced a file:

1. **Check file first** using the Read tool or Bash:
   - Verify it exists
   - Check size: must be under 10MB. If larger, tell the user:
     > "That file is too large (max 10MB). Try a smaller document, or extract the key sections into a text file."
   - Check type: PDF, MD, or TXT only. If other format:
     > "DeepMiro accepts PDF, Markdown, or plain text files. Can you convert it?"

2. **Upload the file:**
   - If `upload_document` MCP tool is available (stdio/local): call it with the file path
   - If MCP tool is NOT available or errors (remote/hosted mode): upload via curl instead:
     ```bash
     curl -sf -X POST "$DEEPMIRO_URL/api/documents/upload" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPMIRO_API_KEY" \
       -F "file=@/path/to/file.pdf"
     ```
   - Extract `document_id` from the response

3. Tell user: "Uploaded your document — I'll use it to build the knowledge graph."

No file? Skip to Step 3.

### Step 2.5: Enrich the prompt (IMPORTANT — do this for every prediction)

Before sending the prompt to DeepMiro, YOU must enrich it. The simulation engine extracts named entities from the prompt to create personas. A vague prompt like "how will people react to X" produces zero personas.

**Your job:** Rewrite the user's prompt into a rich scenario description that includes:
- **Specific stakeholder groups** with descriptive names (not just "people")
- **Named organizations** that would be involved
- **The context** — what happened, when, why it matters
- **Opposing viewpoints** — who supports, who opposes, who's neutral

**Example:**
User says: "How will crypto affect government record keeping?"

You rewrite to: "A major US government agency announces it will pilot blockchain-based record keeping for land titles and tax records. Key stakeholders include: the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the American Bankers Association, Coinbase and Ethereum Foundation as blockchain advocates, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) representing privacy concerns, state-level IT directors from Texas and California, taxpayer advocacy groups, and investigative journalists from The Washington Post and Wired. The debate centers on transparency vs privacy, cost savings vs implementation risk, and innovation vs proven systems."

**Show the user what you changed:**
> "Your prompt was a bit broad for the simulation engine — I've added some context to help it create better personas. Here's what I'm sending:
>
> *[show the enriched prompt]*
>
> Want me to adjust anything before I run it?"

Wait for confirmation, then proceed. Do NOT list specific personas — the engine decides who to create based on the text.

### Step 3: Choose preset

- **"quick"** — user said "quick", "fast", "rough idea" → 10 agents, 20 rounds
- **"standard"** (default) — most predictions → 20 agents, 40 rounds
- **"deep"** — user said "deep", "thorough", or uploaded a large PDF → 50+ agents, 72 rounds

If large document uploaded, suggest deep: "This is a detailed document — running deep simulation with 50+ personas."

### Step 4: Create simulation

Call `create_simulation` with prompt, document_id (optional), preset.

> "Simulation started! I'll narrate what happens as the personas interact.
> You can keep working — I'll update you as it progresses."

### Step 5: Monitor and narrate

Poll `simulation_status` every 30 seconds. Narrate naturally based on `phase`:

**building_graph:**
> "Building a knowledge graph from your input... extracting entities and relationships. {progress}%"

**generating_profiles:**
> "Creating personas: {profiles_generated} of {entities_count} ready — {recent_profiles}"
> Example: "Li Wei (Student), Prof. Zhang (Faculty), Campus Daily (Media)..."

**simulating:**
Narrate the simulation like a story. Use entity names and action content from `recent_actions`:
> "Round 15/40 — 127 interactions so far.
> Prof. Zhang just tweeted: 'Our research output this semester shows remarkable growth...'
> Li Wei liked the post. Chongqing Upstream News is discussing the controversy on Reddit."

**completed:** Move to Step 6.

If over 15 minutes: "The deep simulation is still running — I'll let you know when it's done. Feel free to keep working."

### Step 6: Present report

Call `get_report`. Present the full analysis to the user.

Then offer next steps:
> "Simulation complete! You can:
> - **Interview a persona** — 'ask Li Wei why he liked that post'
> - **Run another scenario** — 'predict [new scenario]'
> - **Search past sims** — 'show my past predictions'"

### Step 7: Interview (optional)

If user wants to talk to a persona:
1. Call `interview_agent` with simulation_id, agent name, and their question
2. Present the response in character — as if the persona is answering directly

---

## Rules

- **Names, never IDs** — say "Prof. Zhang" not "Agent_34" or "agent_id: 7"
- **No base64 file uploads** — always use `upload_document` first, pass `document_id` to `create_simulation`
- **Error recovery** — if simulation fails, offer to retry with a smaller preset
- **Quick predict** — if user just wants a fast take without a full simulation, use `quick_predict` and mention the full sim is available for deeper analysis
- **Be conversational** — narrate the simulation like you're watching it unfold, not reading logs
